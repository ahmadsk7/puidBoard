# TODO

## Core Features

- YouTube song search + YouTube to MP3 converter in backend for custom music
- Global sound effects to hotkeys (audio + SVG) - gunshot, DJ airhorn, etc.
- Fix button grab logic - require active mouse press to move (no click-then-move)
- Add controls to separate beat and voice from sound
- Fix red (hop) #7 hotkey logic - tap to set marker, hold to play layered audio on top of current track

## Additional Improvements

- Save/load project state (user sessions/mixes)
- Export/record final mixed audio output
- Visual waveform display enhancements
