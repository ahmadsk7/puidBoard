# TODO

1. adding a youtube song search + use youtibe to mp3 converter in backend so people can have whatever music they want
2. adding global sound effects to the global hotkeys (audio and svg, gunshot noise, dj airhorn
3. fixing all button grab logic. buttons MUST be actively pressed wuth mosue button to move.. no weird click then move logic that feels chucnky (current state)
4. add controls to seperate beat and voice from sound
5. fix the logic with the red (hop) # 7 hotkey.. maybe tap to set new marker and then hold (to let it play for as long as you hold it)..? (and it should be layered audio.. ontop of current track not a rewind..)
6. save/load project state (sessions)
7. export/record final mixed audio
